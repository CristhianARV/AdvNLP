We will use the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) programming language, with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to write instructions and log your results."

    "### Conda environment manager\n",
    "If you want to manage several versions of Python and its modules, a good idea is to install an environment manager such as Conda.   Before installing Python and Jupyter locally, installing Conda will help you manage different versions of Python and of other modules on your computer, for instance for several courses.  (You may wish to install Conda before Python, but you can also do it later, in which case it will install its own Python libraries.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Miniconda is a minimal environment manager, while Anaconda is a larger software distribution that includes also Python and R software.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To install Conda, follow the instructions at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html and consider installing **Miniconda**. Follow the instructions for your OS: Windows, Linux or MacOS.\n",
    "* You will be prompted to get a suitable installer from https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main (an executable for Windows, or a `bash` script for Linux).\n",
    "* In Linux, run `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` and then\n",
    "`bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "* Conda commands are the same on all OSs -- the most important ones are for creating and loading an environment\n",
    "* after you install Conda, commands are performed from the command line (command prompt, a Power Shell, Anaconda Prompt, etc.)\n",
    "* try `conda info` for a start.\n",
    "* to get familiar with Conda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html\n",
    "* cheatsheat of Conda commands: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html\n",
    "* to create an environment called *AdvNLP* for this course and activate it:\n",
    "   * `conda create --name AdvNLP python=3.14`\n",
    "   * `conda activate AdvNLP`\n",
    "   * `conda list` to see what packages are installed in the activated conda environment\n",
    "   * `conda deactivate` to exit from the environment\n",
    "   \n",
    "You can also perform a system-wide installation of Python, without Conda environments, but this is more prone to conflicts beween packages and versions.  To install Python 3.14 (the latest stable Python 3 version) follow the instructions at https://www.python.org/downloads/."

    "\n",
    "Installing the Jupyter server will allow you to open, edit, and run notebooks.  With a local version (as opposed to cloud-based Colab), you will be able to work offline, and you will also gain first-hand experience with Python and Jupyter installation.\n",
    "\n",

    "  * All these operations are done in the command line (on Windows: `cmd` or Power Shell).  \n",

    "\n",
    "You can use the free cloud-based environment provided by Google, named [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  You will need a Google or Gmail account, and your files will be stored on your Google Drive.  Once you open a session in Colab, you will need to import the AdvNLP Jupyter notebooks to Colab.  This environment is offered by Google for machine learning experiments, with CPU / GPU / TPU computation, but not for time-consuming jobs.  All Python packages that we will use are already installed."
